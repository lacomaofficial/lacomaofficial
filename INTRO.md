# Cognitive & Computational Neuroscience Intro

### 1. **Input – What Are We Giving to the Brain?**
- **Role in the Brain:** Sensory information is processed to form an initial understanding.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Visual Cortex (Occipital Lobe):** If the input involves color, shape, or other visual details, the visual cortex is crucial for decoding that information.
  - **Somatosensory Cortex (Parietal Lobe):** If weight or tactile properties are involved, this area processes sensory input related to touch and proprioception.

### 2. **Layers – How Does the Brain Process This Info?**
- **Role in the Brain:** Different stages of processing, with each layer focusing on specific aspects of the input.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Hierarchical Processing in Visual Areas:** For visual processing, the brain uses layers, starting from the **primary visual cortex (V1)** for basic features (e.g., edges), moving to **higher-order areas (V2, V4)** for more complex representations like shapes and colors.
  - **Multisensory Integration in the Parietal Cortex:** Higher-order layers could involve the **parietal cortex** for integrating visual and tactile data to produce a coherent representation of the object.

### 3. **Weights and Bias – How Does the Brain Know What’s Important?**
- **Role in the Brain:** Some sensory features are weighted more heavily based on experience and expectation.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** Assigns importance to different features based on goals, expectations, and context (e.g., if you're expecting apples, color might be weighted more heavily).
  - **Basal Ganglia:** Plays a role in reinforcement learning and decision-making, helping the brain decide which clues are relevant over time by adjusting weights based on previous experience.

### 4. **Activation Functions – How Does the Brain Make Flexible Decisions?**
- **Role in the Brain:** Determines whether a piece of information should be activated or suppressed.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):** Involved in conflict detection and decision-making. It helps resolve whether conflicting sensory input is relevant (e.g., is the orange fruit round but not the right color?).
  - **Thalamus:** Acts as a relay station, controlling what sensory information gets through to higher brain areas, similar to activating or inhibiting certain signals.

### 5. **Learning – How Does the Brain Improve Over Time?**
- **Role in the Brain:** The brain updates its internal model based on feedback to improve future decisions.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Hippocampus:** Crucial for learning and memory. It helps store feedback from past decisions (e.g., learning from mistakes).
  - **Basal Ganglia and Dopamine Pathways:** Key in reinforcement learning, where correct predictions reinforce good strategies and wrong guesses lead to adjustment (similar to how machine learning models update weights).

### 6. **Training – Doing This Many Times**
- **Role in the Brain:** Repetition strengthens neural pathways and solidifies learning.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Motor Cortex and Cerebellum:** Involved in repetitive learning, especially for procedural tasks. In the case of recognizing fruits, the **ventral stream** (part of the visual cortex leading to the temporal lobe) becomes specialized through repetition.
  - **Striatum (part of Basal Ganglia):** Plays a role in habit formation, refining responses with repeated feedback loops.

### 7. **Loss Function – How Does the Brain Measure Its Mistakes?**
- **Role in the Brain:** The brain evaluates how far off a guess was from reality, adjusting accordingly.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC):** Processes errors and outcomes, particularly in value-based decision-making, helping the brain calculate "loss" and adjust strategies.
  - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):** Also involved in error monitoring and detecting whether something went wrong.
&nbsp;

### 8. **Optimizer – How Does the Brain Get Better?**
- **Role in the Brain:** The brain adjusts its decision-making strategies to improve over time.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Dopaminergic System (Substantia Nigra and Ventral Tegmental Area):** Plays a major role in reward-based learning and adjusting expectations. Dopamine levels guide the brain's optimization process by reinforcing correct predictions.
  - **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** Helps optimize decision-making by weighing past experiences and guiding future choices.

### 9. **Overfitting – What Happens When the Brain Gets Too Good?**
- **Role in the Brain:** The brain might overlearn specific details that work for one set of stimuli but fail with new ones.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Hippocampus:** Involved in episodic memory and specific learning, which could lead to overfitting by focusing too much on particular past examples.
  - **Generalization Mechanisms in the PFC:** To prevent overfitting, the **prefrontal cortex** helps generalize lessons learned to new situations by integrating a broader range of information rather than over-relying on past experiences.
&nbsp;

### 10. **Tuning – Finding the Best Settings**
- **Role in the Brain:** Adjusting strategies and thresholds (like how much importance to give color vs. shape) to improve decision-making.
- **Brain Areas Involved:**
  - **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** Involved in adjusting strategies dynamically based on outcomes (hyperparameter tuning in machine learning).
  - **Basal Ganglia:** Optimizes motor and cognitive strategies through trial and error, adjusting neural "settings" based on rewards and punishments.

### Summary:
Each step in the machine learning analogy has a **brain equivalent** where various **neural structures** process, learn, and refine decisions. The key areas include:
- **Sensory processing areas** like the visual and somatosensory cortices.
- **Learning and memory areas** like the hippocampus and basal ganglia.
- **Decision-making centers** like the prefrontal cortex and dopaminergic pathways.
