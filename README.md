# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! New here? Iâ€™m Jay

I'm a future computational neuroscientist focused on predicting and optimizing treatments for mental health conditions using advanced data analysis techniques. My work lies at the intersection of neuroscience, data science, and machine learning, and I'm driven by the potential of these fields to unlock new insights into brain function and health.

### Stock Markey Analysis App
1. **Finding the Company Name**: To look up a company's name on Yahoo Finance, use this link: [Yahoo Finance Nikkei 225](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EN225/). For example, to find Nike's ticker, you would use ^N225.

2. **Interpreting the Charts**:
   - The **red line** on the chart represents the stock price.
   - The **blue line** indicates the buy signal.
   - **Rules for Buying or Selling**:
     - If the blue line rises to 4, it suggests you should buy the stock at 100%.
     - If the blue line falls below 0, it's a signal to sell the stock.

3. **Using the Signals**: This system is designed for medium and long-term investments. It combines mathematical functions and market signals in a simplified manner to aid in investment decisions.
