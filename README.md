- ### **ADHD Prediction using Resting-State fMRI Connectivity Analysis** 
  This project applies machine learning techniques to identify ADHD biomarkers through resting-state fMRI connectivity patterns, utilizing SVMs to classify individuals based on their brain connectivity profiles.



- ### **N400 ERP in Picture-Word Semantic Integration**
  An examination of brain processing of semantic integration through EEG data analysis, focusing on the N400 ERP component during picture-word mismatch trials.



- ### **Resting-State fMRI SVM Classifier**
  A classification project that distinguishes between children and adults based on resting-state fMRI signal patterns using a support vector machine.


- ### **Neuro-Decoding with MLPs on PyTorch**
  Decoding neural signals from the Haxby dataset using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) within the PyTorch framework.



- ### **Neuro-Decoding with LightGBM Classifier**
  Utilizes LightGBM to decode brain signals, focusing on cognitive pattern recognition within the Haxby dataset.



- ### **Regression Model to Predict Age from Resting-State fMRI Data**
  Predicts age from brain scans, uncovering functional connectivity patterns between the transverse sinus and inferior occipital gyrus, providing insights into brain aging.
